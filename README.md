# Weather App

This is a weather app using the OpenWeatherAPI.

It uses an MVI architectural pattern, compose, and Ktor for network requests.

In the `main` branch, you can a version which allows users to enter a zip code and get weather data of the area they searched for the next 5 days.

The `architecture-branch` branch, contains an over-engineered project structure and architecture, showing possibilities of how we can highly abstract out the modules that make up our app.
